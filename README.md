# Stock Market Trend Analysis

## Background 

The purpose of this project is to determine the annual changes for all the stocks listed in the US stock exchange during 2014-2016.  To accomplish this, a VBA script will be written from the given CSV datasets.

## Requirements

#### 1. Create a VBA script that will display the following information for each stock:

* Ticker Symbol
* Annual Price Change 
* Annual Percent Price Change 
* Annual Total Stock Volume

#### 2. Use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

#### 3. Upon retrieving these results, determine the ticker symbol with the following:

* Greatest Increase in Annual Percent Price Change
* Greatest Decrease in Annual Percent Price Change
* Greatest Annual Total Stock Volume

## Datasets:
* [Multiple Year Stock Data](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Stock-Market-Trend-Analysis/blob/main/Final%20Results/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx)

* [Single Year Stock Data (Test)](https://github.com/cecileung1208/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Test/Unit%202%20-%20VBA_Homework_Instructions_Resources_alphabetical_testing%20-%20Verifying.xlsm) 

## Method 
* Start with the Single Year Stock Data and do the following for all stocks:
  * Sort the data in chronological order for all stocks.
  * Determine the opening price for the first day of the year and the closing price for the last day of the year to calculate price change and % price change.
* Write a VBA script that displays the following: 
  * Stock Ticker Symbol
  * Annual Price Change
  * Annual % Price Change
  * Annual total stock volume.
* Upon successfully displaying the above information, write another VBA script based on the results to determine the following:
  * Greatest annual increase in percent price change 
  * Greatest annual decrease in ppercent price change 
  * Greatest annual total volume.
* Repeat process for the Multiple Year Stock Data.
