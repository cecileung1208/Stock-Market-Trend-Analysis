# Stock Market Trend Analysis

## Background 

The purpose of this project is to determine the annual changes for all the stocks listed in the US stock exchange.  To accomplish this, a VBA script will be written from the given CSV datasets.


## Requirements

#### 1. Create a VBA script that will display the results of the following information for each stock:

* Ticker Symbol
* Annual Change between:
    * Opening Price at the Beginning of the Year
    * Closing Price at the End of the Year<br>
* Percent Change between: 
    * Opening Price at the Beginning of the Year
    * Closing Price at the End of the Year
* Total Stock Volume

#### 2. Use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Resources

### Datasets:

1.  [Excel Test File](https://github.com/cecileung1208/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Test/Unit%202%20-%20VBA_Homework_Instructions_Resources_alphabetical_testing%20-%20Verifying.xlsm) to ensure that the code runs properly and the results match by validating against the excel formula.

## Results

### **1.  Final Results**

Please run the code in the following order:

1.  [Stock Summary Final VBA Script](https://github.com/cecileung1208/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Final%20Results/StockSummaryFinal.bas) that runs the code through the tabs for 2014-2016.

2.  [Stock Challenge Final VBA Script](https://github.com/cecileung1208/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Final%20Results/StockChallengeFinal.bas) that runs the code through the tabs for 2014-2016.

3.  [Outputs](https://github.com/cecileung1208/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Final%20Results/VBA%20Homework%20-%20Output.docx) for the Stock Summary and Challenge for 2014-2016.

#### **Note:**
**Please run the codes in sequential order as item 2 is dependent upon item 1.


### **2.  Test**

Test Files are created to ensure that the code works properly.

1.  [Excel Test File](https://github.com/cecileung1208/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Test/Unit%202%20-%20VBA_Homework_Instructions_Resources_alphabetical_testing%20-%20Verifying.xlsm) to ensure that the code runs properly and the results match by validating against the excel formula.

2.  [Stock Summary VBA Script](https://github.com/cecileung1208/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Test/StockSummary.bas) that runs the tickers starting with letters A-F and P.

3.  [Stock Challenge VBA Script](https://github.com/cecileung1208/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Test/StockChallenge.bas) that runs the tickers starting with letters A-F and P.

4.  [Reset Script](https://github.com/cecileung1208/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Test/Reset.bas) to clear the contents so it is more convinient to reset and test the codes repeatedly.
